## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/abhi9vaidya/guitariz/issues) that might help you. In case you've found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.
